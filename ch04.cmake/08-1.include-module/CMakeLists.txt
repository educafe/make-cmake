# Module -----
# When given a module name, the include() command will look in 
# a well-defined set of locations for a file whose name is 
# the name of the module (case-sensitive) with .cmake appended.
# When looking for a moduleâ€™s file, CMake first consults the variable 
# CMAKE_MODULE_PATH. 
# This is assumed to be a list of directories and CMake will search 
# each of these in order. The first matching file will be used, 
# or if no matching file is found or 
# if CMAKE_MODULE_PATH is empty or undefined, CMake will then search 
# in its own internal module directory.
